`@codeqr/analytics` is a lightweight (~1kb), [open-source](https://github.com/codeqr-io/analytics) client-side script for [tracking conversion events](https://codeqr.co/help/article/codeqr-conversions) with CodeQR.

The script handles the detection of the `cq_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

If you're using CodeQR Partners, this script also lets you [track clicks on the client-side](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`). This gives you the flexibility to track clicks directly on your website or app, without needing to rely on link redirects.
