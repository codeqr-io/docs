description: Track clicks on the client-side using query parameters
---

import CodeQRAnalyticsParams from "/snippets/codeqr-analytics-params-react.mdx";
import VerifyTrackClick from "/snippets/verify-track-click.mdx";

With the [`@codeqr/analytics` script](/sdks/client-side/introduction), you can track clicks on the client-side using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`, `?ref=jane`).

A few use cases include:

- You're using [CodeQR Partners](https://codeqr.io/help/article/codeqr-partners) with [dual-sided incentives](https://codeqr.co/help/article/dual-sided-incentives) and want to display a banner that says: _"John referred you to Acme and gave you 25% off"_
- You have dynamically generated referral pages (e.g. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/referral/peeroke520149)) and want to track clicks [using a `trackClick()` function](#manually-tracking-clicks-with-the-trackclick-function) inside your application code.
- You are migrating from an existing affiliate management platform (e.g. [Rewardful](https://codeqr.co/help/article/migrating-from-rewardful)) that uses query parameters to track conversions.

## Quickstart

Here's how you can enable client-side click-tracking with the `@codeqr/analytics` script:

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a custom domain to your CodeQR workspace">

First, you'll need to [add a custom short link domain](https://codeqr.co/help/article/how-to-add-custom-domain) to your CodeQR workspace. You can use a domain you already own, or leverage our [free .link domain offer](https://codeqr.co/help/article/free-dot-link-domain) to register a custom domain like `yourcompany.link` for free.

This is the domain that you'll use for your short links on CodeQR.

</Step>

<Step title="Allowlist your site's domain">

Then, you'll need to allowlist your site's domain to allow the client-side click events to be ingested by CodeQR. To do that, navigate to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.codeqr.co/settings/analytics) and add your site's domain to the **Allowed Hostnames** list.

    alt="Enabling conversion tracking for a workspace"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  When testing things out locally, you can add `localhost` to the **Allowed
  Hostnames** list temporarily. This will allow local events to be ingested by
  CodeQR. Don't forget to remove it once you're ready to go live!
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Install the CodeQR client-side SDK">

Next, install the CodeQR [client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction) and initialize it with the domain you added in the previous step.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript React/Next.js
// install the package (e.g. npm install @codeqr/analytics)
import { Analytics as CodeQRAnalytics } from "@codeqr/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <CodeQRAnalytics
        domainsConfig={{
          refer: "go.example.com", // the custom domain you're using on CodeQR for your short links
        }}
      />
      {/* Your app code here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

```javascript Other Frameworks
// include this script tag in your HTML Head tag
<script
  src="https://codeqr-cdn.pages.dev/analytics/script.js"
  data-domains="{'refer': 'go.example.com'}"
  defer
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

Here's the full list of parameters you can pass to the script:

<Accordion title="Parameters">
  <CodeQRAnalyticsParams />
</Accordion>

</Step>

<Step title="(Optional, but recommended): Set up a reverse proxy">

To avoid ad-blockers from blocking your click-tracking requests, we recommend setting up a reverse proxy.

Refer to the [Reverse-proxy support](/sdks/client-side/features/reverse-proxy-support) guide to learn how to set one up.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify your setup">

To verify that your click-tracking is working, run your website locally and append the URL with the unique key of your short link

For example, if your short link is `https://go.example.com/abc123`, you'll need to append `?via=abc123` to the URL.

Once you've done that, check if the following is true:

<VerifyTrackClick />

</Step>

</Steps>

## Automatically fetching partner and discount data

If you're using [CodeQR Partners](/partners/quickstart) with [dual-sided incentives](https://codeqr.co/help/article/dual-sided-incentives), the script will automatically fetch the partner and discount data for you when someone lands on your site via a valid referral link.

This data will be stored as a JSON-stringified object in the `codeqr_partner_data` cookie in the following format:

```json
{
  "clickId": "xxx", // unique ID of the click event
  "partner": {
    "id": "pn_xxx", // unique ID of the partner on CodeQR
    "name": "John Doe", // name of the partner
    "image": "https://example.com/john.png" // avatar of the partner
  },
  "discount": {
    "id": "disc_xxx", // unique ID of the discount on CodeQR
    "amount": 25, // discount amount (either a percentage or a fixed amount)
    "type": "percentage", // type of the discount (either "percentage" or "fixed")
    "maxDuration": 3 // maximum duration of the discount in months
  }
}
```

To access this cookie data, we recommend using a cookie library like [`js-cookie`](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) – here's an example:

```js
import Cookies from "js-cookie";

const codeqrPartnerData = Cookies.get("codeqr_partner_data");
const { partner, discount } = codeqrPartnerData ? JSON.parse(codeqrPartnerData) : {};

// Display a banner that says: _"John referred you to Acme and gave you 25% off"_

return (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <img src={image} alt={name} className="size-6 rounded-full" />
    <p>
      {name} referred you to Acme and gave you {amount} {type} off
    </p>
  </div>
);
```

Here's an example of how the discount banner will look like:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/codeqr-partner-data.png"
    alt="A screenshot of the CodeQR partner data example"
  />
</Frame>

## Manually tracking clicks with the `trackClick()` function

This is helpful for tracking clicks on:

- Dynamically generated referral pages (e.g. [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/referral/peeroke520149))
- Dynamic user-generated content/webpages:
  - CodeQR's public analytics dashboards (e.g. [app.codeqr.co/share/:slug](https://app.codeqr.co/share/dash_6NSA6vNm017MZwfzt8SubNSZ))
  - Cal.com's booking pages (e.g. [cal.com/steven](https://cal.com/steven))
  - Tella's video pages (e.g. [tella.tv/video/:slug](https://www.tella.tv/video/cluvcfcfi00tw0fjrgizr4pw2))
