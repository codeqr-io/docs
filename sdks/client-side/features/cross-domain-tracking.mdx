title: Cross-domain tracking
description: Track conversions across domains

By default, the script already sets the `codeqr_id` cookie on a **cross-domain level**.

This means that if you have the script installed on your marketing site (e.g. **example.com**), the cookie will also be accessible when your user signs up for your app (e.g. **app.example.com**).

However, if you are installing the script on a subdomain (e.g. **app.example.com**), you will need to set the following option to make sure the cookie is accessible on the apex domain as well (e.g. **example.com**):

<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
<CodeQRAnalytics
  cookieOptions={{
    domain: ".example.com",
  }}
/>
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://codeqr-cdn.pages.dev/analytics/script.js"
  data-cookie-options='{"domain": ".example.com"}'
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

The script also supports conversion tracking across _entirely different domains_.

This means that if you have the script installed on a separate domain (e.g. **example.sh**), you can use the `outboundDomains` prop to ensure that the `codeqr_id` cookie value is automatically appended to all outbound links targeting your main domain (e.g. **example.com**).

<CodeGroup>
```typescript React
// install this script on both domains
<CodeQRAnalytics
  domainsConfig={{
    outbound: ["example.com", "example.sh"],
  }}
/>
```

```html Other
<script
  src="https://codeqr-cdn.pages.dev/analytics/script.outbound-domains.js"
  data-domains="{'outbound': ['example.com', 'example.sh']}"
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  For outbound-domains support, you'll need to use the
  [`script.outbound-domains.js`](/sdks/client-side/variants#outbound-domains-variant-script-outbound-domains-js)
  variant of the script. Learn more about [how script variants
  work](/sdks/client-side/variants).
