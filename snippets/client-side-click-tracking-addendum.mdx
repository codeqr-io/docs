If you're using [CodeQR Partners](/partners/quickstart) for affiliate management, you will also need to set up the `data-domains` property to enable [client-side click-tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking).

```html
<script
  src="https://codeqr-cdn.pages.dev/analytics/script.js"
  defer
  data-domains="{'refer':'yourcompany.link'}"
/>
```

Read the [client-side click-tracking guide](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking) for more information.
