<Tip>
  If you are using Shopify, you can skip this step since our Shopify app will
  automatically track conversions for you. Read the [Shopify integration
  guide](https://codeqr.io/docs/conversions/sales/shopify) for more information.

CodeQR uses server-side event tracking to track conversions, which is more reliable than client-side tracking. Depending on which framework you're using, you can use our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview):

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="TypeScript" icon="npm" href="/sdks/typescript" horizontal>
    TypeScript library for the CodeQR API
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Go"
    icon="golang"

    Go library for the CodeQR API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Python" icon="python" href="/sdks/quickstart/python" horizontal>

  </Card>
  <Card title="Ruby" icon="gem" href="/sdks/quickstart/ruby" horizontal>
    Ruby library for the CodeQR API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you're using a framework that isn't listed, you can use the CodeQR REST API to track events on the server-side:

- [`POST /track/lead`](https://codeqr.io/docs/api-reference/endpoint/track-lead)
- [`POST /track/sale`](https://codeqr.io/docs/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale)

Once you install the SDKs, you can start tracking conversion events.

### Tracking lead events

The first event you'll want to track is a `lead` event. This happens when a user performs an action that indicates interest in your product or service. This could be anything from:

- Signing up for an account
- Adding a product to cart
- Joining a mailing list

  />
</Frame>

Our most common lead event is `Sign Up`, which happens when a user signs up for an account. Depending on which authentication framework you're using, here are a few examples of how to send `Sign Up` lead events:

<AuthProviders />

The lead event will serve as the source of truth for the customer's identity and which link they came from. This means that all subsequent actions performed by the customer (e.g. upgrading their plan, purchasing a product) will automatically be attributed to the original link.

### Tracking sale events

The second event you'll want to send is a `sale` event. This happens when a user purchases your product or service. This could be anything from:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product

Depending on which payment processor you're using, we offer native integrations for the following:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Stripe"
    icon="stripe"
    href="https://codeqr.io/docs/conversions/sales/stripe"

  <Card
    title="Shopify"
    icon="shopify"
    href="https://codeqr.io/docs/conversions/sales/shopify"
    horizontal
  />
</CardGroup>

Alternatively, you can also send sale events manually using [our SDKs](/sdks/overview) or the [`POST /track/sale` API endpoint](https://codeqr.io/docs/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale).
