[CodeQR Partners](https://codeqr.io/help/article/codeqr-partners) lets you build powerful, scalable referral and affiliate programs with 1-click global payouts and white-labeling functionality.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with CodeQR Partners:

1. [Install the `@codeqr/analytics` client-side SDK](#step-1-install-the-codeqr-analytics-client-side-sdk)
2. [Install the CodeQR server-side SDK + track conversion events](#step-2-install-the-codeqr-server-side-sdk--track-conversion-events)
3. [Set up your partner program](#step-3-set-up-your-partner-program)

## Step 1: Install the `@codeqr/analytics` client-side SDK

First, you'll need to install the [@codeqr/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).

This script detects the `cq_id` query parameter and storing it as a first-party cookie, which will be used to attribute subsequent conversion events to the original link.

On top of that, it also:

- lets you [track clicks on the client-side](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking) using query parameters (e.g. `?via=john`)
- [automatically fetch the partner and discount data](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking#automatically-fetching-partner-and-discount-data) for a given link – which is helpful for displaying [dual-sided incentives](https://codeqr.io/help/article/dual-sided-incentives)

Once the script is installed, make sure to verify that [client-side click tracking](/sdks/client-side/features/client-side-click-tracking) is working as expected by checking if the following is true:

<VerifyTrackClick />

## Step 2: Install the CodeQR server-side SDK + track conversion events

## Step 3: Set up your partner program

Once you have conversion tracking up and running, you can follow these steps to set up your partner program:

1. Go through the [program onboarding flow](https://app.codeqr.io/programs) to create your program.
   - If you're migrating from another platform, you can also import your partners and historical conversions (e.g. [from Rewardful](https://codeqr.io/help/article/migrating-from-rewardful)).
2. [Connect your bank account](https://codeqr.io/help/article/how-to-set-up-bank-account) for partner payouts.
3. [Invite your partners](https://codeqr.io/help/article/inviting-partners) to join your program + set up your [program application form](https://codeqr.io/help/article/inviting-partners#via-a-branded-application-form) for future partners.
4. Create [custom reward rules](https://codeqr.io/help/article/partner-rewards) and [dual-sided incentives](https://codeqr.io/help/article/dual-sided-incentives) to incentivize partners to share your link with others.
5. Set up a [whitelabeled referral dashboard](/partners/white-labeling) that lives directly inside your app so your users can automatically enroll in your partner program without leaving your app.
