<Note>
  Conversion tracking require a [Business plan](https://codeqr.iopricing)
  subscription or higher.
</Note>

When it comes to [conversion tracking](/conversions/quickstart), a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product via [Stripe Payment Links](#option-1-using-stripe-payment-links)

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sale events with Stripe as the payment processor by leveraging CodeQR's Stripe integration.

## Installing the CodeQR Stripe integration

CodeQR comes with a powerful Stripe integration that automatically listens to payment events on Stripe and track them as sales on CodeQR.

Here's how you can install the CodeQR Stripe integration:

<Steps>
<Step title="Find CodeQR on the Stripe App Marketplace">
 Navigate to the [CodeQR Stripe Integration](https://d.to/stripe/app) on the Stripe App Marketplace.
 
<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-marketplace.png"
    alt="The CodeQR: Conversions Analytics page on the Stripe App Marketplace"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>
<Step title="Install the Stripe app">
  On the top right, click on **Install app** to install the CodeQR Conversions app on your Stripe account.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-install.png"
    alt="The Stripe integration installation flow"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Alternatively, you can also install the Stripe app in test mode first to test
  your end-to-end flow without involving real money.
</Tip>

Once the app is installed, click on **Continue to app settings** to finish the installation.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-install-continue.png"
    alt="Continue to app settings"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect Stripe to your CodeQR workspace">

In the app settings page, click on **Connect workspace** to connect your Stripe account with your CodeQR workspace.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-connect-workspace.png"
    alt="Connect Stripe to CodeQR"
  />
</Frame>

This will redirect you to the [CodeQR OAuth flow](/integrations/quickstart), where you can select the CodeQR workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/select-codeqr-workspace.png"
    alt="Select the CodeQR workspace you want to connect to your Stripe account"
  />
</Frame>

Once you click on **Authorize**, you will be redirected back to the CodeQR app settings page on Stripe, where you should see that the integration is now installed.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stripe/stripe-app-installed.png"
    alt="The Stripe integration is now installed"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

</Steps>

Once the integration is installed, CodeQR will automatically listen to the following events on Stripe and track them as sales on CodeQR:

- `customer.created`: When a new customer is created
- `customer.updated`: When a customer is updated
- `checkout.session.completed`: When a customer completes a checkout session
- `invoice.paid`: When an invoice is paid (for tracking recurring subscriptions)
- `charge.refunded`: When a charge is refunded (for tracking refunds and updating payout commissions for [CodeQR Partners](https://codeqr.io/partners))

## Tracking sales with the CodeQR Stripe integration

Depending on your setup, there are a few ways you can track sales with the CodeQR Stripe integration.

- [Option 1: Using Stripe Payment Links](#option-1%3A-using-stripe-payment-links)
- [Option 2: Using Stripe Checkout (recommended)](#option-2%3A-using-stripe-checkout-recommended)
- [Option 3: Using Stripe Customers](#option-3%3A-using-stripe-customers)

### Option 1: Using Stripe Payment Links

<Tip>
  For this option to work, you need to [install the CodeQR Stripe
  integration](#installing-the-codeqr-stripe-integration) and [enable conversion
  tracking for your
  links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
  first.
</Tip>

If you're using [Stripe Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), simply add a `?codeqr_client_reference_id=1` query parameter to your Stripe Payment Link when shortening it on CodeQR.

Then, when a user clicks on the shortened link, CodeQR will automatically append the unique click ID as the `client_reference_id` [query parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters) to the payment link.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="https://assets.codeqr.iocms/conversions-payment-links.jpg"
    alt="Stripe payment link with CodeQR click ID"
  />
</Frame>

Finally, when the user completes the checkout flow, CodeQR will automatically [track the sale event](/api-reference/endpoint/track-sale) and [update the customer's `externalId`](/api-reference/endpoint/update-a-customer) with their Stripe customer ID for future reference.

Alternatively, if you have a marketing site that you're redirecting your users to first, you can do this instead:

1. [Install the @codeqr/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction), which automatically detects the `cq_id` in the URL and stores it as a first-party cookie on your site.
2. Then, retrieve and append the `cq_id` value as the `client_reference_id` parameter to the payment links on your pricing page / CTA button (prefixed with `codeqr_id_`).

   ```
   https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxxx?client_reference_id=codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

<Accordion title="What if I'm using Stripe Pricing Tables?">
  If you're using [Stripe Pricing Tables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) â€“ you'd want to pass the CodeQR click ID as a [`client-reference-id` attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#handle-fulfillment-with-the-stripe-api) instead:

  <CodeGroup>

```html HTML
<body>
  <h1>We offer plans that help any business!</h1>
  <!-- Paste your embed code script here. -->
  <script async src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js"></script>
  <stripe-pricing-table
    pricing-table-id="{{PRICING_TABLE_ID}}"
    publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
    client-reference-id="codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  >
  </stripe-pricing-table>
</body>
```

```jsx React
import * as React from "react";

function PricingPage() {
  // Paste the stripe-pricing-table snippet in your React component
  return (
    <stripe-pricing-table
      pricing-table-id="'{{PRICING_TABLE_ID}}'"
      publishable-key="pk_test_51ODHJvFacAXKeDpJsgWLQJSzBIDtCUFN6MoB4IIXKJDfWdFmiEO4JuvAU1A0Y2Ri4m4q1egIfwYy3s72cUBRCwXC00GQhEZuXa"
      client-reference-id="codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ></stripe-pricing-table>
  );
}

export default PricingPage;
```

  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I'm using Stripe's Checkout Sessions API?">

If you're using Stripe's [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) for a recurring subscription service, you might want to check out our [Stripe Checkout option](#option-2%3A-using-stripe-checkout-recommended) instead.

If your setup doesn't involve a [lead event](/conversions/leads/introduction) and goes straight to the Stripe checkout flow (e.g. for one-time purchases), you can simply pass the CodeQR click ID (prefixed with `codeqr_id_`) as the [`client_reference_id` parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-client_reference_id) to enable conversion tracking with CodeQR.

  <CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  line_items: [
    {
      price: "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      quantity: 2,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  client_reference_id: "codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});
```

```python Python
  stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    success_url="https://example.com/success",
    line_items=[{"price": "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "quantity": 2}],
    mode="payment",
    client_reference_id="codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  )
```

```go Go
  params := &stripe.CheckoutSessionParams{
    SuccessURL: stripe.String("https://example.com/success"),
    LineItems: []*stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
      &stripe.CheckoutSessionLineItemParams{
        Price: stripe.String("price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
        Quantity: stripe.Int64(2),
      },
    },
    Mode: stripe.String(string(stripe.CheckoutSessionModePayment)),
    ClientReferenceID: stripe.String("codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"),
  };
  result, err := session.New(params);
```

```php PHP
  $stripe->checkout->sessions->create([
    'success_url' => 'https://example.com/success',
    'line_items' => [
      [
        'price' => 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        'quantity' => 2,
      ],
    ],
    'mode' => 'payment',
    'client_reference_id' => "codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  ]);
```

```ruby Ruby
  Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
    success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
    line_items: [
      {
        price: 'price_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        quantity: 2,
      },
    ],
    mode: 'payment',
    client_reference_id: "codeqr_id_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  })
```

  </CodeGroup>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Option 2: Using Stripe Checkout (recommended)

If you have a custom checkout flow that uses Stripe's `checkout.sessions.create` API, you'd want to associate the [Stripe customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) with the user's unique ID in your database (which we tracked in the [lead conversion tracking step](/conversions/leads/introduction)).

This will allow CodeQR to automatically listen for purchase events from Stripe and associate them with the original click event (and by extension, the link that the user came from).

<Accordion title="How does this work?">

Remember in the [lead conversion tracking guide](/conversions/leads/introduction), we passed the user's unique user ID along with the click event ID in the `codeqr.track.lead` call?

```javascript Node.js
await codeqr.track.lead({
  clickId,
  eventName: "Sign Up",
  externalId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
  customerName: user.name,
  customerEmail: user.email,
  customerAvatar: user.image,
});
```

Under the hood, CodeQR records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from.

Then, when the user makes a purchase, CodeQR will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer â€“Â and by extension, the original click event.

</Accordion>

First, you'll need to complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Install the CodeQR Stripe integration](#installing-the-codeqr-stripe-integration)
2. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
3. [Install the @codeqr/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)
4. [Install the CodeQR server-side SDK](/conversions/quickstart#step-3-install-the-codeqr-server-side-sdk)

Then, when you [create a checkout session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create), pass your customer's unique user ID in your database as the `codeqrCustomerId` value in the `metadata` field.

```javascript Node.js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const priceId = "price_xxxxxxxxx";

const stripeSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  customer_email: user.email,
  success_url: "https://app.domain.com/success",
  line_items: [{ price: priceId, quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "subscription",
  client_reference_id: user.teamId,
  metadata: {
    codeqrCustomerId: user.id, // the unique user ID of the customer in your database
  },
});
```

This way, when the customer completes their checkout session, CodeQR will automatically associate the checkout session details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the customer â€“Â and by extension, the original click event.

### Option 3: Using Stripe Customers

Alternatively, if you don't use Stripe's [checkout session creation flow](#option-2%3A-using-stripe-checkout-recommended), you can also pass the user ID and the click event ID (`cq_id`) in the [Stripe customer creation flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create).

First, you'll need to complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Install the CodeQR Stripe integration](#installing-the-codeqr-stripe-integration)
2. [Enable conversion tracking for your links](/conversions/quickstart#step-1-enable-conversion-tracking-for-your-links)
3. [Install the @codeqr/analytics client-side SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction)

Then, when you [create a Stripe customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create), pass the user's unique user ID in your database as the `codeqrCustomerId` value in the `metadata` field.

```javascript Node.js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const cq_id = req.headers.get("cq_id");

await stripe.customers.create({
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  metadata: {
    codeqrCustomerId: user.id,
    codeqrClickId: cq_id,
  },
});
```

Alternatively, you can also pass the `codeqrCustomerId` and `codeqrClickId` values in the `metadata` field of the [Stripe customer update flow](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update):

```javascript Node.js
import { stripe } from "@/lib/stripe";

const user = {
  id: "user_123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxx",
};

const cq_id = req.headers.get("cq_id");

await stripe.customers.update(user.id, {
  metadata: {
    codeqrCustomerId: user.id,
    codeqrClickId: cq_id,
  },
});
```

This way, when the customer makes a purchase, CodeQR will automatically associate the purchase details (invoice amount, currency, etc.) with the original click event.

## Currency conversion support

If you're using [Stripe's Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing) feature, CodeQR will record the sale amount using the currency of your Stripe account:

```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
  "id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
  "object": "event",
  "type": "checkout.session.completed",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
      "object": "checkout.session",
      "currency": "cad",
      "amount_subtotal": 2055,
      "amount_total": 2055,
      "currency_conversion": {
        "amount_subtotal": 1500,
        "amount_total": 1500, // this is the amount that CodeQR will record
        "source_currency": "usd", // the currency of your Stripe account
        "fx_rate": "1.37"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you're not using Stripe Adaptive Pricing, CodeQR will record the sale amount in the default currency of your CodeQR workspace. This means that if you pass a different currency, it will be automatically converted to USD for reporting consistency â€“Â using the latest foreign exchange rates.

```json checkout.session.completed
// Stripe checkout.session.completed event payload
{
  "id": "{{EVENT_ID}}",
  "object": "event",
  "type": "checkout.session.completed",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
      "object": "checkout.session",
      "currency": "cad",
      "amount_subtotal": 2055,
      "amount_total": 2055 // this will be converted from CAD to USD
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The default currency for all CodeQR workspaces is currently set to `USD`. We will
  add the ability to customize that in the future.
