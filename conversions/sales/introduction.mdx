<Note>
  Conversion tracking require a [Business plan](https://codeqr.iopricing)
  subscription or higher.
</Note>

When it comes to [conversion tracking](/conversions/quickstart), a `sale` event happens when a user purchases your product or service. Examples include:

- Subscribing to a paid plan
- Usage expansion (upgrading from one plan to another)
- Purchasing a product from your online store

In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking sales conversion events with CodeQR.

## Step 1: Configure sale tracking

Next, depending on which payment processor you're using, you can leverage our native integrations to track sale events:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Stripe"
    icon="stripe"
    href="/conversions/sales/stripe"
    horizontal
  >
    Tracking sale conversion events with Stripe and the CodeQR SDK
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Shopify"
    icon="shopify"
    href="/conversions/sales/shopify"
    horizontal
  >
    Tracking sale conversion events with Shopify and the CodeQR SDK
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you're not using any of the providers listed above, you can also manually track sale events using our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview) within your backend code:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import CodeQR from "@codeqr/ts";

const codeqr = new CodeQR();

await codeqr.track.sale({
  externalId: "cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA",
  amount: 100,
  paymentProcessor: "stripe",
  eventName: "E-book purchase",
  invoiceId: "123456",
  currency: "usd",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: View conversion results

And that's it – you're all set! You can now sit back, relax, and watch your conversion revenue grow. We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:

## Currency conversion support

For simplicity, CodeQR records all sales in the default currency of your CodeQR workspace. This means that if you pass a different currency, it will be automatically converted to USD for reporting consistency – using the latest foreign exchange rates.

```typescript TypScript
await codeqr.track.sale({
  externalId: "cus_RBfbD57HDzPKpduI8elr5qHA",
  amount: 15480, // this will be converted from PLN to USD
  currency: "pln",
  paymentProcessor: "stripe",
  eventName: "Purchase",
});
```

<Note>
  The default currency for all CodeQR workspaces is currently set to `USD`. We
  will add the ability to customize that in the future.
