In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application as lead events on CodeQR.

<LeadsPrerequisites />

## Configure lead tracking

Depending on which authentication framework you're using, we have a few pre-built guides to help you track lead events when a new user signs up for your SaaS application:

<AuthProviders />

<Tip>
  If you're using the [Remix framework](https://remix.run/), you might run into an [issue](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/7922) where you get an empty/null value for the `cq_id` cookie. In that case, try using a library like [`cookie`](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie) instead:

```typescript
import cookie from "cookie";

const cookies = cookie.parse(request.headers.get("cookie") ?? "");
const codeqrId = cookies.cq_id;
```

</Tip>

If you're not using any of the frameworks listed above, you can use the following steps to track lead events:

1. Within the sign-up API request, retrieve the `cq_id` cookie that was created by the [`@codeqr/analytics` client-SDK](/sdks/client-side/introduction).
2. Send an event to the CodeQR API with the `cq_id` value, as well as your customer's ID and any other relevant information (email, name, avatar, etc.)

<Tip>
  If you don't have a customer ID, you can also use the customer's `email`
  instead.
</Tip>

## Code examples

Here are some examples of how you can track lead events using our [native SDKs](/sdks/overview):

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import CodeQR from "@codeqr/ts";

const codeqr = new CodeQR();

const codeqrId = req.cookies["cq_id"];
if (codeqrId) {
  await codeqr.track.lead({
    clickId: codeqrId,
    eventName: "Sign Up",
    externalId: customer.id,
    customerName: customer.name,
    customerEmail: customer.email,
    customerAvatar: customer.avatar,
  });
  // delete the cq_id cookie
  res.cookies.set("cq_id", "", {
    expires: new Date(0),
  });
}
```
