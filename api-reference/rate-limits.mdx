CodeQR's API rate limiting is in conformance with the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| Header Name             | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.              |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.    |
| `Retry-After`           | The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request again.                |

CodeQR's API is capped at **60 requests per minute** per key on the Free plan, with elevated limits for [Pro plan](https://codeqr.io/help/article/pro-plan) and above.

This is implemented to ensure a fair usage policy so that excessive use by a single user does not adversely affect the performance and usage of the API by others.

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the rate limit is exceeded.

## Rate limits by plan

Depending on your CodeQR plan, you can expect the following rate limits:

| Plan                                                     | Rate limit                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free                                                     | 60 requests per minute                                                     |
| [Starter](https://codeqr.io/help/article/starter-plan)   | 150 requests per minute                                                    |
| [Pro](https://codeqr.io/help/article/pro-plan)           | 600 requests per minute                                                    |
| [Business](https://codeqr.io/help/article/business-plan) | 3,000 requests per minute                                                  |

## How to comply with rate limits

Here are some tips on how you can optimize your API setup to comply with our rate limits:

### 1. Bulk link creation

If you need to create a lot of links within a short period of time, try our [bulk link creation endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/bulk-create-links) instead (create up to 100 links in one API call)

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
await codeqr.links.createMany([
  {
    url: "https://google.com",
  },
  {
    url: "https://twitter.com",
  },
  {
    url: "https://linkedin.com",
  },
]);
```

</CodeGroup>
    
### 2. Fetch project-level analytics

If you're using our [Analytics API](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics), instead of retrieving the clicks count for every single link, try making a single API call to get workspace-level click analytics instead.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
await codeqr.analytics.retrieve({
  groupBy: "top_links",
  start: "4 hours ago", // we support natural language for start/end params
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Leverage webhooks

If you're expecting high volume, fast-changing data (e.g. thousands of clicks on your links per day) and would prefer to store the data on your end, we recommend using our [real-time webhooks feature](https://codeqr.io/blog/introducing-webhooks) instead.

[Webhooks](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) are _push-based_, meaning that CodeQR will send events to your webhook receiver endpoint when specific events occur, while a REST API is _pull-based_, meaning that you need to consistently poll the API endpoint to get real-time updates.
