<Info>
  CodeQR's API is now generally available. [Read the
  announcement](https://codeqr.io/blog/announcing-codeqr-api).
</Info>

## Base URL

CodeQR's API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```bash Terminal
https://api.codeqr.io
```

## Authentication

Authentication to CodeQR's API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word `Bearer` followed by your API key in your requests like so:

```bash Terminal
Authorization: Bearer codeqr_xxxxxx
```

Here are examples of how to authenticate with CodeQR's API in different programming languages:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer codeqr_xxxxxx'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Native SDKs

CodeQR offers native SDKs in some of the most popular programming languages:

- [TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript)

You can find the full list of SDKs [here](/sdks/overview).

## Error Handling

CodeQR API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.

Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found.",
    "doc_url": "https://codeqr.mintlify.app/api-reference/errors#not-found"
  }
}
```

Here is a list of all error codes CodeQR API returns:

## Pagination

CodeQR's API supports pagination. This is useful when you have a large number of resources and you want to retrieve them in smaller chunks.

These list API methods share a common set of parameters that allow you to control the number of items returned and the page number. For example, you can:

- [retrieve a list of links](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-links)
- [retrieve a list of domains](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-domains)
- [retrieve a list of events](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-a-list-of-events)

### Parameters

<ParamField body="page" type="string" default="1">
  The page number to retrieve. By default, the first page is returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pageSize" type="string">
  The number of items to retrieve per page. The default value varies by
  endpoint. Maximum value is 100.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sortBy" type="string">
  The field to sort the results by.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sortOrder" type="string">
  The order to sort the results by. Can be `asc` or `desc`.
</ParamField>

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the first page of 10 links:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links?page=1&pageSize=10 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

```javascript Node.js
const res = await codeqr.links.list({
  page: 1,
  pageSize: 10,
});
```

</CodeGroup>
