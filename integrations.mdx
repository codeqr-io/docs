## Building your own integrations

You can build your own integrations with CodeQR's infrastructure for both **links** and **QR Codes** using our [API](/api-reference/introduction).

1. Read the documentation on how to [create links](/api-reference/endpoint/create-a-link) or [create QR Codes](/api-reference/endpoint/create-a-qrcode).
2. Learn how to [integrate CodeQR into your application](/integrations/quickstart).
3. [Reach out to us](https://codeqr.io/contact/support) to feature your integration in the integrations marketplace.

## Integration webhooks

CodeQR also supports webhooks for integrations. You can use these webhooks to track events for both links and QR Codes. Learn more in the [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks/introduction) documentation.
