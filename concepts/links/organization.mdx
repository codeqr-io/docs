When creating links programmatically with CodeQR, you might want a way to associate them with a user or other identifiers in your system.

There are a few ways to do this, depending on your data structure:

| Method                      | Type         | Description                                        | Use case                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [External ID](#external-id) | One-to-one   | A unique identifier for a link within your system. | Associating referral links with users in your system.                                                 |
| [Tenant ID](#tenant-id)     | One-to-many  | The ID of the tenant that created the link.        | Grouping all links created by a user/team in your system.                                             |
| [Tags](#tags)               | Many-to-many | Grouping links by tags                             | Organizing links by campaign / user / various for flexible, multi-dimensional filtering and reporting |

## External ID

In certain scenarios, it is essential to identify links within your system. For instance, you may need to associate a link with a user without storing the CodeQR link ID directly in your database (e.g. for referral links).

The `externalId` field serves this purpose effectively. It acts as a unique identifier within your database, allowing you to associate it with a corresponding link in CodeQR's system.

CodeQR allows you to create links using an `externalId` and subsequently retrieve them by the same identifier.

<Note>
  `externalId` should be a unique value across your project. Trying to create
  a link with an externalId that already exists will result in a [`409` conflict
  error](/api-reference/introduction#conflict) error.
</Note>

### Create link with an externalId

Here is an example of how to create a link with an `externalId`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://google.com",
    "external_id": "12345"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve link by externalId

Let's see how to retrieve a link by its `externalId`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links/info?external_id=12345 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Update link by externalId

In addition to updating a link by its `linkId`, you can also update a link by its `externalId`.

<Note>
  Make sure to prefix the `externalId` with `ext_`. For example, if your
  `externalId` is `12345`, you should pass `ext_12345`.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links/ext_12345 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"url": "https://www.google.uk"}'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve analytics by externalId

You can also retrieve analytics for a link by its `externalId`. This is helpful for fetching the analytics for a given link using the unique identifier from your system.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/analytics?external_id=ext_12345 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Tenant ID

The ID of the tenant that created the link inside your system. If set, it can be used to fetch all links for a tenant. This is useful if you have a system that lets your users create their own links, and you want to group them on a tenant level.

### Create link with tenantId

Let's see how to create a link with a tenant ID:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://google.com",
    "external_id": "12345"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve links by tenantId

Here is how to retrieve links by tenant ID:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links?tenantId=12345 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve analytics by tenantId

You can retrieve analytics by tenantId by passing the `tenantId` prop. This is helpful for fetching the analytics for all the links under a specific tenant, or the total analytics for a tenant.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/analytics?tenantId=12345 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Tags

Tags are a great way to organize your links on CodeQR.

With tags, you can:

- Organize your links by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
- [Filter your links by tags](#retrieve-links-by-tags) and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
- [Filter your analytics by tags](#retrieve-analytics-by-tags) to see how your campaigns are performing.

### Create link with tags

You can use either pass the tag ID or tag name to create a link with tags.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "tagIds": ["clux0rgak00011..."]
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve links by tags

You can retrieve links by tag by tags.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/links?tagNames=tag1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retrieve analytics by tags

You can retrieve analytics for a tag (or multiple tags) by passing the `tagIds` prop. This is helpful for fetching the analytics for all the links under a specific tag, or the total analytics for a tag (or multiple tags).

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.codeqr.io/analytics?tagIds=tag_xxx \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
